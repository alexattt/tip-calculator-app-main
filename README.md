# Frontend Mentor challenge - Tip calculator app

<p>
  My version of Tip calculator app for Frontend mentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX).
</p>
<p>I decided to use HTML, SCSS and vannila JS for this challenge.</p>
<p>How to use app - input the total bill amount, choose % of tip (or input custom one), input amount of people.</p>
<p>Then app will calculate tip per person and total amount a person has to pay.</p>
<p>Solution page can be found here - https://alexattt.github.io/tip-calculator-app-main/</p>
